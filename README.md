## What is LinkedHU?
It's a platform to see your friend's posts, connect, chat, see job applications shared by graduates and TAs and so much more
- See your Professor's Events (Such as a lecture or a gathering)

- Chat easily without worrying about typo's or drunk-texts. Don't worry, we do NOT notify people when they receive a new message :D There's a good chance they will never notice it's there <hehe>

- Edit your profile: 
-- Change your user type when you graduate,
-- Share your social links for people to access them directly from your profile
-- Delete your profile to vanish from the whole platform and leave others wondering if you're a magician
